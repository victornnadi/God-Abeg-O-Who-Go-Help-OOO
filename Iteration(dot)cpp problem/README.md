I must learn programming in Jesus name. 

My 7 year programming journey has been filled with obstacles(bugs) 
that make me to throw my hands in the air. To be fair, I have never 
just had a reason to learn programming, I just liked it. But now, I
need it for my preferred career and I must learn it. So this 
repository is for those codes with naughty unresolvable bugs that 
try to chase me away from this journey. I realize that I never 
really had someone with more experience that I could show my code
for guidance. So I will put the code along with a similarly named 
note containing what the error and issue is. So if you can see them, 
please help with corrections, thank you so much.
